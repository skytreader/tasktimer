# What's this?
Something I created during the early days of my senior year as an undergraduate.
This was meant to help me track how much time I spend on what.

All code, not very clean. The implementation uses Swing and MySQL.

# What now?
I plan to clean this up and, maybe, get a web implementation running. It's high
time I need something like this again.
